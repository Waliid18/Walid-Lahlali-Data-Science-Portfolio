    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the **first** step in a comprehensive project aimed at exploring **the correlation between financial investment and performance outcomes in European football clubs**. Our ultimate goal is to analyze how various financial metrics—such as **`revenue`**, **`spending`**, and **`net`** balance—relate to performance indicators like **`goals scored`**, **`wins`**, **`losses`**, and final league **`positions`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we start by gathering the necessary data through **web scraping**. Using the popular website **`Transfermarkt`**, which provides detailed information on **player transfers**, **team finances**, and **league standings**, we focus on collecting data from the top **15** European football leagues. Specifically, we target the **top 10** teams in each league, totaling **150** teams, to build a dataset that will form the foundation of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will guide you through the process of **scraping** data related to player transfers and league standings for these teams. The scraped data will include essential financial metrics as well as performance metrics across multiple seasons. Once **collected**, this data will be **cleaned**, **processed**, and **organized** in a structured format, ready for the subsequent stages of analysis in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have compiled a comprehensive dataset that captures the financial and performance aspects of **top European football teams**. This dataset will enable us to conduct a deeper analysis in future notebooks, where we will explore the relationship between financial spending and team success, aiming to uncover meaningful insights about the financial efficiency and competitive performance of football clubs."

    "### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to **import the essential** Python libraries. These libraries are required for various tasks such as sending HTTP **requests** (using requests), introducing delays between requests (using **time**), **parsing HTML** pages (using **BeautifulSoup**), and manipulating data (using **numpy** and **pandas**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Defining HTTP Headers and Base URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, **HTTP headers** are defined to make the requests appear as if they are coming from a regular web browser, which helps in avoiding blocks by the website. The base URL of the Transfermarkt website is also defined, making it easier to construct the complete URLs needed to access specific pages later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Requesting the European Leagues Page:\n",
    "\n",
    "A request is sent to the webpage listing the European leagues on Transfermarkt. The content of the page is retrieved and parsed using BeautifulSoup to extract the necessary information if the request is successful. If the request fails, an error message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Extracting Links for the Top 15 European Leagues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the European leagues page is parsed, the code identifies and extracts the links to the top **15** most important leagues by iterating through the rows of the table that contains this information. Each link is stored in a dictionary, with the league name as the key and the URL as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Cleaning and Converting Financial Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is defined to clean and convert financial values (e.g., \"**€1.5m**\" to 1500000.0). This function removes currency symbols and converts abbreviations (like \"**k**\" for thousand and \"**m**\" for million) into full numerical values. If the conversion fails, the function returns a missing value (np.nan).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Requesting Transfer Data for Each League:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script iterates over the league links extracted earlier to retrieve the main page and the transfer balance page for each league. Delays of 2 seconds are introduced between requests to avoid overwhelming the server. The retrieved pages are then parsed using BeautifulSoup to extract the relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Extracting and Storing Team Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The script identifies the relevant rows in the transfer balance pages and the team pages for the top **10** teams in each league. Additional requests are made to retrieve the team pages and league position pages, and the extracted information is stored in a dictionary, organized by league and team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Isolating and Processing Useful Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific data such as **revenue**, **spend**, **goals**, **league rankings**, and match results (**wins**, **ties**, **losses**) are isolated from the retrieved HTML content. These data points are cleaned and processed to be stored in the data dictionary. The script also ensures that the years of the transfer data and league rankings match to avoid errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Creating a DataFrame from the Collected Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "After all the data is collected and organized in the dictionary, it is converted into a Pandas DataFrame, a tabular data structure commonly used in Python. This DataFrame contains all the extracted and processed information, organized in a way that is ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Calculating 5-Season Aggregates:\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame is then enriched by calculating aggregated metrics over a 5-season window for each team. These metrics include rolling sums and averages for revenue, spend, and other financial indicators, allowing for the analysis of trends over multiple seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Creating the Final DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the final DataFrame is generated, bringing together all the processed data and making it ready for further analysis. This DataFrame contains detailed information on the financial and performance metrics of the teams from the top European leagues across multiple seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Saving the DataFrame as a CSV File\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the DataFrame containing all the scraped and processed data has been created, the next step is to save it as a **CSV** file. Saving the DataFrame as a CSV ensures that the data is preserved and can be **easily accessed** or shared without needing to re-run the entire scraping process. We can also **avoid the time-consuming** task of scraping again if we want to revisit the data for further analysis or make adjustments. This allows us to **focus** on the analytical steps in subsequent notebooks."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we successfully completed the initial and crucial step of data collection for our broader project, which aims to analyze the correlation between financial metrics and performance outcomes in European football clubs. By employing **web scraping** techniques, we gathered comprehensive data on player transfers, **team finances**, and league standings from Transfermarkt for the top **150** teams across the top **15** European leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through meticulous scraping and data processing, we have compiled a robust dataset that includes key financial metrics—such as **`revenue`**, **`spent`**, and **`net`** balance—alongside **performance metrics** like **`goals`** scored, **`wins`**, **`losses`**, and final league **`positions`**. This dataset is now structured and ready for deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **data collected** in this notebook will serve as the foundation for the next stages of our project, where we will analyze the relationships between financial investment and team performance. By exploring these correlations, we aim to gain insights into the financial strategies of football clubs and their impact on success in domestic leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has laid the groundwork for our analysis, ensuring that we have reliable and well-organized data to draw meaningful conclusions about **`the financial efficiency and competitive performance of European football teams`** in subsequent analyses."
