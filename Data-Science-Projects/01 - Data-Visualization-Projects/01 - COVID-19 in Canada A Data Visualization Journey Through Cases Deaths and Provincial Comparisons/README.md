ðŸ“Š COVID-19 in Canada: A Data Visualization Journey

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada through an in-depth data visualization journey. It highlights trends in confirmed cases and deaths while drawing comparisons across provinces. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of regional disparities and temporal trends during the pandemic.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Notebook: COVID-19 in Canada A Data Visualization Journey.ipynb
Contains detailed analyses, data transformations, and visualizations.
Dataset: canada_covid19.csv
Source data on COVID-19 cases and deaths across Canada.
Visualizations: Includes exported graphs and charts generated for the analysis.

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description

Source: COVID-19 case and death data from Canadian provincial reports.
Size:
3180 rows, covering daily reports for 13 provinces/territories from February 2020 to May 2021.
7 columns, including total cases, death counts, and calculated rates.
Key Statistics:
Total cases reported: 1,370,000+.
Total deaths reported: 25,000+.
Missing data: 6.7% in ratecases_total and ratedeaths.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Findings

National Trends:

Canada saw the highest surge in cases during the second wave (November 2020â€“January 2021), peaking at over 7,000 daily cases nationwide.
December 2020 recorded the highest death toll, with 3,000+ deaths in a single month.
Provincial Analysis:

Ontario and QuÃ©bec contributed to 65% of total cases and 70% of deaths in Canada.
Nunavut, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories had less than 1,000 cases combined, highlighting the disparity in COVID-19's impact.
Temporal Patterns:

The first wave began in March 2020, with cases growing steadily until May 2020.
Subsequent waves showed higher peaks and longer durations, reflecting increased community transmission.
Mortality Rates:

QuÃ©bec had the highest death rate, with 4.5 deaths per 100,000 population.
Other provinces, such as British Columbia and Alberta, maintained lower death rates despite high case counts.

ðŸ”‘ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how effective data visualization can uncover significant insights into the dynamics of a pandemic. By exploring regional disparities and national trends, it provides valuable perspectives for public health policymakers and researchers. The findings underline the need for tailored responses to public health crises, considering both regional and temporal factors.
