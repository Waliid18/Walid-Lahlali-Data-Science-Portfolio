## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Findings

+ **National Trends:**

  + Canada saw the **highest surge** in **cases** during the **second wave** (**`November 2020â€“January 2021v**), peaking at over **7,000** daily cases nationwide.
  + **`December 2020`** recorded the **highest death** toll, with **3,000+** deaths in a single month.
    
+ **Provincial Analysis:**

  + **`Ontario`** and **`Quebec`** contributed to **65%** of **`total cases`** and **70%** of **`deaths`** in Canada.
  + **`Nunavut`**, **`Yukon`**, and the **`Northwest Territories`** had **less** than **1,000 cases** combined, highlighting the disparity in COVID-19's impact.
    
+ **Temporal Patterns:**

  + The **first wave** began in **`March 2020`**, with **`cases`** **growing steadily** until **`May 2020`**.
  + **Subsequent waves** showed **higher peaks** and **longer durations**, reflecting increased community transmission.

+ **Mortality Rates:**

  + **`Quebec`** had the **highest `death rate`**, with **4.5** deaths per **100,000** population.
  + Other provinces, such as **`British Columbia`** and **`Alberta`**, maintained **lower `death rates`** despite high case counts.
