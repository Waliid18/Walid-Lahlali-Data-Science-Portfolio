# ðŸ“ˆ The Evolution of Canadaâ€™s Immigration Between 1980 and 2013


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth **analysis of Canadaâ€™s immigration trends from 1980 to 2013**, using historical data from **195 countries** worldwide. The analysis explores immigration patterns over time and across **`regions`**, examining distinctions between **`developed`** and **`developing`** regions and uncovering valuable insights on the **contributions** of **`continents`**, **`regions`**, and specific **`countries`**, including a focused study on **`Africa`**, **`North Africa`**, and **`Morocco`**. As an **African** and **Moroccan**, I have incorporated a comprehensive exploration of immigration from these areas to gain perspective on the migration patterns from **my continent** and **homeland**. Through **`data exploration`** and **`visualizations`**, this project aims to identify significant **trends**, **economic** and **geographic** influences, and notable peaks or declines in immigration numbers, providing a detailed understanding of **Canada's diverse immigrant population**.
